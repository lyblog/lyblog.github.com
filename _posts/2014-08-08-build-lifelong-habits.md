title: "Building lifelong habits"
---

Now I almost dare say I've build a lifelong habit of physical exercise. For more than 100 days, I do push-ups, crouches and crunches 5-6 days a week, average 70 minutes a time. Also before I resigned last month, I did cycling 50 minutes a day. I'm really satisfied of my body.

This changed me a lot. Physical exercise is the first GOOD thing that I carry on for a long time(more than 3 months). I become much more confident and optimistic. After it became a habit, I no longer need willpower to persist. I just love to do it and enjoy the process.

It's said that habits are formed by completing a task for 21 days in a row. I don't care whether is 21 days or 30 day, etc. It needs some time anyway. In 2012, I took a online projects named "Learning on Steroids". The first month is a `30-day trial'. Students need to focus on one particular learning skill in a month. Scott, the founder of the project, provided some learning skills which need to execise a lot. It's best to develop habits to obtain these skills. I spent $15 only to failed. The only thing I got is the notion of habit-building. Very glad I suceed to build one good habit 2 years later;-)

The next habits I want to build are: meditation, writing diaries, active thinking while reading
